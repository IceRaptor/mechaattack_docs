Humanoid robots bearing assault cannons dash from cover to cover, while explosions rock the ground underneath their feet. Massive tanks command dominating positions and pour unrelenting fire into any victim hapless enough to wander into their sights. Deep in forests and the urban jungle infantry in exoskeletons take up positions waiting for the unwary or hapless. Heavily armed and armored helicopters and more exotic attack craft circle the battlefield, seeking stragglers to pick off one by one. Sound like fun? Then you may enjoy CAMS. 


# CAMS

CAMS is a miniatures wargame designed to capture the feel of Votoms, Patlabor and other examples of the real-robot genre. In this world combat suits are used alongside tanks and infantry in an organic way, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Tanks remain the frontline force used to seize ground, while mobile artillery and airborne drones prepare the way. Infantry advance behind the main wave and dig in, forming a bulkhead against counter-attacks. Combat suits rapidly respond to quick incursions and push combat towards their heavier cousins, while avoiding the front line where they would quickly be destroyed.
