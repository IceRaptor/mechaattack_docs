# General

## Tests
The success of actions in CAMS are decided by a the roll of one or more eight-sided die. The number of dice to roll will be given as #D8. The player rolls all of these dice and gains one success for each dice that is equal to or better than the models __skill rating__. A models skill rating varies by their experience; novices have a rating of 7+ while veteran troopers have a 3+. So while both models may roll 3D8, the veteran is more likely to succeed compared to the novice.

Many actions require __opposed tests__, where both the active player and their target make their own test, then compare the number of successes against each other. If the target has more successes than the active player, or the active player fails to roll at least one success, the target wins the opposed test. Otherwise the active player wins the test and counts the difference between the rolls as the __margin of success__.

{{% alert theme="success" %}}Example: Two players are in an opposed test. The active player rolls 4D8 and gets [3, 5, 7, 7]. Their skill rating is 5+, so they have three successes. The target player rolls 3D8 and gets [2, 6, 6]. Because their skill rating is 4+, they have two successes. The attacker has 3 successes to the targets 2 success, thus the _margin of success_ is 1. {{% /alert %}}

Some actions do not have a target player, only have an active player. For these _unopposed tests_ the attacker compares their successes against a __target number__. 

### Bonus Successes
Tactical positioning or advanced equipment can ensure a successful action has an outsized effect. When an effect grants __bonus successes__, if the player rolls at _least one success_ on their dice, they add any bonus successes to the successes they rolled. If no successes are rolled, bonus successes are not added.

{{% alert theme="success" %}}Example: A player has 2 bonus successes and rolls 3D8 against a rating of 5+. They roll [3, 5, 8] which would normally be 2 successes. Because they have at least one success from their dice roll, they add their bonus successes for a total of 4 successes.{{% /alert %}}

## Measuring
Players are free to measure at any point during play. When measuring distances, always measure the closest point to the closest point.

## Unit Characteristics
Units are defined by various characteristics and traits.

* Combat Points (CP): The number of points required to field this unit. 
* Size: The volume of the unit, given as a

# Sequence of Play
Each game of CAMS consists of a number of game turns, each of which is broken down into phases. The phases of play are:

1. Strategic phase
2. Activation phase
3. Cleanup phase

## Strategic Phase
Commanders attempt to marshall support forces or reserve their command for unit effects.

- Call artillery
- Call airstrikes
- Marshal reserves
- Direct guidance
- Claiming initiative

## Activation phase
During this phase, players take turns nominating and activating squads one at a time until all squads have been activated.The player with initiative nominates one of their squads, and rolls the squads leadership rating to activate them. If the player gets at least one success the squad activates. In addition each success grants the squad one action During an activation each model isis moved, and each success grants the squad one action that may be spent during the activation. Each unit must be assigned at least one action, but any additional actions can be distributed as the player sees fit.

Each model in the squad is activated one at a time. Each model chooses a stance, makes any movement it desires, and spends its actions at any point during that movement as it likes. 

### Movement
Combat is a dangerous affair, and generally units move at a cautious rate. When necessary they can move as quickly as possible, or stop and take careful aim. By default models are assumed to be in their __combat stance__, which balances movement, attack and defense. In combat stance the model moves up its __movement rating__ in inches. 

When speed is necessary models may choose to adopt an __evasive__ stance. In this stance take their normal movement, and may make additional moves by spending one or more actions. For each action spent, the model may move up to it's __movement rating__ in inches and gains an __evasion__ token. Each evasion token grants +1 bonus success to any defensive test until the start of the unit's next activation. 

Models in a defensible position may choose to adopt the __focused__ stance. In this stance the unit may not take their normal movement, but gains a __focused__ token. The model may spend one or more actions to add an additional focused token. For each focused token the model gains +1 bonus success to any non-defense test. 

#### Difficult and Impassable Terrain
Dense bogs, thick forests and jagged rocks can prove impassable to vehicles and infantry alike. When units want to move through this terrain they must slow down and carefully pick their way through. When a unit wants to move through terrain on its turn, it needs to
