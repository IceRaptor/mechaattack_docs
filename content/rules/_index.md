# Tests
The success of actions in CAMS are decided by a the roll of one or more eight-sided die. The number of dice to roll will be given as #D8. The player rolls all of these dice and gains one success for each dice that is equal to or better than the models __skill rating__. A models skill rating varies by their experience; novices have a rating of 7+ while veteran troopers have a 3+. So while both models may roll 3D8, the veteran is more likely to succeed compared to the novice.

Many actions require __opposed tests__, where both the active player and their target make their own test, then compare the number of successes against each other. If the target has more successes than the active player, or the active player fails to roll at least one success, the target wins the opposed test. Otherwise the active player wins the test and counts the difference between the rolls as the __margin of success__.

{{% alert theme="success" %}}Example: Two players are in an opposed test. The active player rolls 4D8 and gets [3, 5, 7, 7]. Their skill rating is 5+, so they have three successes. The target player rolls 3D8 and gets [2, 6, 6]. Because their skill rating is 4+, they have two successes. The attacker has 3 successes to the targets 2 success, thus the _margin of success_ is 1. {{% /alert %}}

Some actions do not have a target player, only have an active player. For these _unopposed tests_ the attacker compares their successes against a __target number__. 

## Bonus Successes
Tactical positioning or advanced equipment can ensure a successful action has an outsized effect. When an effect grants __bonus successes__, if the player rolls at least one success on their dice, adds the successes to the value they rol
